\section{Introduction}
Supervised machine learning has been used to solve complex classification problems but it requires large amounts of preclassified data for training. Unsupervised machine learning attempts to solve this problem by extracting order from data without a pre-determined solution to compare with. Auto encoders are a specific class of unsupervised network that do this by transforming the data into a latent space with desirable properties and then transforming the latent representation back into a form resembling the original input. The loss function usually involves the accuracy of the reconstruction combined with a parameter representing the conformance of the latent space to the desired form.

This paper will explore the properties of three different auto-encoders and their facility for data compression. One of the common goals of an auto-encoder is to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that, with the appropriate decoder, can be used to reconstruct the original high-dimensional input with minimal reconstruction loss. This is contrasted with a denoising auto-encoder that may have a higher-dimensional latent space than the input, but whose purpose is to reconstruct the original data given a noisy version of the original input. First, this paper will provide a discussion of a linear auto-encoder and its cognates in the machine learning world. Next, the structure will be extended to use a variety of different non-linear activation functions with the goal of improving reconstruction performance in the presence of a non-linear manifold. Finally, the variational auto-encoder will be explored and it's capability to extract the data manifold will be contrasted with the other auto-encoder methods.

\section{The significance of manifold learning}
The crux of solving problems in engineering and science is often data visualization. The real world is full of noise and phenomena that distort and obscure the desired trends. Finding an appropriate transformation that moves the data from the realm of seeming chaos to the realm of interpretable results is therefore key. In the thermal sciences, this is often done by non-dimensionalizing the data to extend applicability to untested cases. In control theory, the LaPlace and Fourier transforms can be used to show the frequency-dependence of the system. Even something so simple as using a logarithmic plot instead of a linear plot is an example of data transformation for visualization.

The fundamental concept behind manifold learning is that the physical processes that give rise to the data are relatively few in number and typically exist in a continuous space. A simple example would be using a camera to record the trajectory of a soccer-ball after it was kicked. The problem could be somewhat accurately simulated using a small number of parameters such as the impulse imparted to the ball by the kick, the point of contact between foot and ball, the presence of wind or friction of the grass, the shape of the ball, and the mass of the ball. This is only six parameters that could vary continuously in the space of all experiments. If the measurement system is a 720x1080 pixel rgb camera at 30fps, and each experiment takes 5 seconds, then the raw measurement data contains 349,920,000 individual pixel values between 0 and 255. Obviously, there is a huge amount of unnecessary data collected by the system. Manifold learning says that if we represent each experiment as a single point in 349,920,000-dimensional space, all of the experiments should lie close to some 6-dimensional manifold or surface where traversing the manifold is equivalent to traversing the original six simulation parameters. It concerns itself with finding an appropriate transform that can map the results of a new experiment to a low-dimensional space where each dimension has a direct physical corollary. 

This concept coincides with the function of an auto-encoder. The encoding portion of an auto-encoder takes a high-dimensional input and reduces it to a low dimensional latent-space. This would correspond to taking the video of the soccer ball and extracting from it the kicking parameters. The decoding portion takes that latent-space and maps it back to the high-dimensional space. In the soccer example, if the latent-space truly represents the physical variables in the system, then then the decoder could also be thought of as a simulator that could reproduce an accurate video of a soccer-ball being kicked based on the desired physical parameters. An auto-encoder can therefore be thought of as a deep network that attempts to learn the relationship between data and the processes that generated the data. It guesses the appropriate encoding and decoding relationships and then tries to extract the latent parameters and simulate the result. It then compares the simulation with the original input and iterates until it finds an acceptable solution. In this way, the complex relationships between process and data can be determined and a useful visualization developed.

This paper will explore auto-encoders using the MNIST dataset which consists of 28x28-pixel images of hand-drawn numeric digits from 0 to 9. The physical process used to create those images was a person moving a pen across paper. We would therefore expect the manifold extracted to have some correspondence to the various strokes of a pen with some additional parameters to account for the variation within each stroke. There are perhaps 10 to 20 distinct strokes that are used to make each character along with a few parameters each to represent degree of curvature or width of each stroke, etc. The hypothesis is therefore that an appropriate latent-space will have a dimensionality of $10^1 < N < 10^2$.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2017 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
long, including figures. This does not include acknowledgments and 
cited references which are allowed on subsequent pages.
Papers that exceed these limits will not be reviewed, or in any
other way considered for presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2017 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
$\sim 15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips_2017.pdf+ contains these instructions and
illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
satisfy.

The only supported style file for NIPS 2017 is \verb+nips_2017.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
  2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The new \LaTeX{} style file contains two optional arguments:
\verb+final+, which creates a camera-ready copy, and \verb+nonatbib+,
which will not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of
package clash.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ option. This will
anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid review.  Please
do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will
be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+nips_2017.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2017+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2017}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule{1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can go over 8 pages as long as the subsequent ones contain
  \emph{only} cited references.}
